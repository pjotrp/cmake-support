= CMAKE =

CMake is the backbone in BioLib. For a full description read the
section in ./doc/DEVELOPMENT.txt first (and perhaps the Biolib website).

Here we list special CMake parameters used with BioLib/ASciLib. It is
incomplete - see the descriptions in ./tools/cmake-support/modules
for more.

== Locating .h, .hpp and .i files ==

To find header files (and SWIG definition files) an INCLUDEPATH is
set by CMake. Adding paths is done with, for example:

  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${MAP_ROOT}/contrib/libsequence-1.6.6)

For SWIG modules a single path can be added to the (to be mapped)
C/C++ library when include files are not in a standard named
location (like src or include) with USE_INCLUDEPATH:

  SET (USE_INCLUDEPATH io_lib)

This path is always relative to ./src/clib/module-version/.

== USE_C_LINKAGE ==

When a C library has been compiled without C++ linkage (aka name
mangling) SWIG modules will fail to find the C functions. Adding:

  SET(USE_C_LINKAGE TRUE)

in a SWIG module will drop name mangling.
